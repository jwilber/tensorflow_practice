Implementation of different things in tensorflow 1.1.0

This is just different implementations of things in tensorflow, for personal practice. Use whatever.

**Warning**: Files might be a tad bit sloppy (e.g. comments not cleaned up, etc.)!

- ***mnist_models***: Contains files for the implementation of the SkipGram word2vec model, as well as preprocessing for the *text8* data file.

- ***String Removal***: Contains implementations of models trained on the MNIST dataset:
                            - Logistic Regression
                            - Neural Network
                            - Convolutional Neural Network
                            - Autoencoder
